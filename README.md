# Smart Alarm for Android Wear

I was annoyed at the lack of stand-alone sleep trackers and smart alarms for android wear, so I made one.

It's pretty bad right now, but it'll get better! Please feel free to pull request - although please don't judge my code too much! :)



## Current Features:
- Sleep Detection
- Accelerometer and Heart Rate tracking
- Configurable polling rates
- Smart Alarm
- Export CSV to email address

## Features I'd like:
- Better number input (like in Alarms app)
- IFTTT integration
- Google Fit integration
- Cleaner interface (and code)
- Multiple alarms and configurable alarm period - Calendar integration?
- Configure sleep detection parameters
